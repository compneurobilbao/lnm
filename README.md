# LNM

Understanding how brain lesions from a stroke affect a patient's behavior is critical for optimizing their care. Traditionally, clinicians link the location of a lesion to a specific functional problem. A major advance in this area is Lesion Network Mapping (LNM), a technique based on the idea that symptoms arise not just from the lesion itself, but from the disruption of entire brain networks.

This tool computes the functional and structural dysconnectivity maps for a given lesion mask and normative dataset.
